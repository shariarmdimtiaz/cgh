# Computer-Generated Holography Articles & Code

The purpose of this repository is to provide a comprehensive list of papers and algorithms for computer-generated holography. The categorization of the papers is based on their class, i.e.:

- Iterative techniques
- Optimization-based techniques
- Machine/Deep learning-based techniques

## Iterative Techniques

This class of algorithms rely on an iterative process to directly enforce the amplitude and/or phase conditions of the holographic set up.

Gerchberg-Saxton | Code: [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/65979-gerchberg-saxton-algorithm) | [Python](https://github.com/topics/gerchberg-saxton-algorithm)

## Optimization-based Techniques

In this class of algorithms, the solution to the CGH problem (phase and/or amplitude) is directly optimized to minimize a loss function that is aimed to maximize the similarity between the desired output and the hologram that results from the modulation. These algorithms often involve an iterative application of an optimizer to gradually approach a decent solution.
